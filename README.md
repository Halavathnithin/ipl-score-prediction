# IPL First Innings Score Prediction   

This project predicts the **first-innings score of an IPL match** using machine learning.  
It takes historical match data, processes features such as teams, venue, current score, overs, and wickets, and predicts the final first-innings score.

##  Project Overview  
Cricket score prediction is an interesting application of machine learning where the goal is to predict how many runs a team will score in their innings. This project focuses on the Indian Premier League (IPL), one of the most competitive cricket leagues in the world.  

The notebook includes:  
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Model training (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
- Performance evaluation (RMSE, RÂ² score)  
- Final prediction pipeline

##  Dataset  
The dataset contains IPL ball-by-ball or match records with features such as:  
- Batting Team  
- Bowling Team  
- Venue  
- Current Score  
- Overs completed  
- Wickets fallen  
- Runs in last 5 overs  

Target variable: **Predicted First Innings Final Score**
